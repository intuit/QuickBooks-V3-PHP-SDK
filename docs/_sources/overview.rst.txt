    Intuit has required QuickBooks Online apps to upgrade to TLS 1.1 or above
    by July 31, 2017 to align with industry best practices for security and data
    integrity. As of December 31, 2017, the required version will be TLS 1.2 or
    higher.


Installation
============

The recommended way to install QuickBooks V3 SDK is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install Composer
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

You can add QuickBooks V3 SDK as a dependency using the composer.phar CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require quickbooks/v3-php-sdk

Alternatively, you can specify QuickBooks V3 SDK as a dependency in your project's
existing composer.json file:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      "require": {
         "quickbooks/v3-php-sdk": ">=4.0.1"
      }
   }

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at `getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.

.. note::

    If you are not famailar with Composer or Composer is not possible to be used in your enviornment,
    you can also go to the "releases" tab to download the zip file version of our PHP SDK.
    See example scripts here https://github.com/intuit/QuickBooks-V3-PHP-SDK/tree/master/src/_Samples for
    how to make QuickBooks Online API call without Composer. You will need to use the

    .. code-block:: php

        include('../config.php');

    to include the necessary autoloader.

   take some time, however, all pull requests in the future should follow the same standards.
2. QuickBooks V3 SDK is meant to be lean and fast with very few dependencies. This means
   that not every feature request will be accepted.
3. QuickBooks V3 SDK has a minimum PHP version requirement of PHP 5.6. Pull requests must
   not require a PHP version greater than PHP 5.6 unless the feature is only
